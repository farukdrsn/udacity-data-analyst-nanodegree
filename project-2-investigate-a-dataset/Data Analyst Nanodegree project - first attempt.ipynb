At the end of this section, describe the questions that you plan on exploring over the course of the report. Try to build your report around the analysis of at least one dependent variable and three independent variables. If you're not sure what questions to ask, then make sure you familiarize yourself with the dataset, its variables and the dataset context for ideas of what to explore.\n\n> If you haven't yet selected and downloaded your data, make sure you do that first before coming back here. In order to work with the data in this workspace, you also need to upload it to the workspace. To do so, click on the jupyter icon in the upper left to be taken back to the workspace directory. There should be an 'Upload' button in the upper right that will let you add your data file(s) to the workspace.

Now that you've trimmed and cleaned your data, you're ready to move on to exploration. Compute statistics and create visualizations with the goal of addressing the research questions that you posed in the Introduction section. It is recommended that you be systematic with your approach. Look at one variable at a time, and then follow it up by looking at relationships between variables.\n\n### Research Question 1 (Replace this header name!)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Use this, and more code cells, to explore your data.

Make sure that you are clear with regards to the limitations of your exploration. If you haven't done any statistical tests, do not imply any statistical conclusions. And make sure you avoid implying causation from correlation!\n\n> **Tip**: Once you are satisfied with your work here, check over your report to make sure that it is satisfies all the areas of the rubric (found on the project submission page at the end of the lesson). You should also probably remove all of the \"Tips\" like this one so that the presentation is as polished as possible.\n\n## Submitting your Project \n\n> Before you submit your project, you need to create a .html or .pdf version of this notebook in the workspace here. To do that, run the code cell below. If it worked correctly, you should get a return code of 0, and you should see the generated .html file in the workspace directory (click on the orange Jupyter icon in the upper left).\n\n> Alternatively, you can download this report as .html via the **File** > **Download as** submenu, and then manually upload it into the workspace directory by clicking on the orange Jupyter icon in the upper left, then using the Upload button.\n\n> Once you've done this, you can submit your project by clicking on the \"Submit Project\" button in the lower right here. This will create and submit a zip file with this .ipynb doc and the .html or .pdf version you created.
